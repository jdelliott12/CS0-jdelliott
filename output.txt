Try this trick and spin it, yeah
And your head on the ground
With your feet on the air

Way out in the water, see it swimmin'

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?

And you'll ask yourself
If there's nothing in it
Your head will collapse
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
And your head on the ground
With your feet on the air

Way out in the water, see it swimmin'

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?

I swear he was trying to talk to me, koi-koi
Except the little fish, bumped into me
Animals were hidin' behind the rocks
I was swimmin' in the Caribbean

Way out in the water, see it swimmin'

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?

And you'll ask yourself
If there's nothing in it
Your head will collapse
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
And your head on the ground
With your feet on the air

Stop
Ooh
